Main application
================

The application can be run in different ways

**********
Standalone
**********

In order to run the application you need to execute the command:

.. code:: console

    $ python dash_cs.py

************
Within Flask
************

You can move the cstrack_dash folder to the folder where the Flask application is running and then register the app in the Flask application. Here we provide a small example.

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask
    import config

    def create_app():
    """Initialize the core application."""
    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)
    app.config.from_object('config.ProdConfig')

    with app.app_context():
        # Include Routes
        from .cstrack_dash import dash_cs as dcs
        app, server = dcs.create_dashboard(app)
        # Register Blueprints
        return app
