************
Installation
************

Clone the CSTrack_URJC Github repository wherever you want to deploy the application.

.. code:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/FernanSLN/CSTrack_URJC.git

Install the package (or add it to your ``requirements.txt`` file):

.. code:: console

    $ pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

In your ``conf.py`` file:

.. code:: python

    import sphinx_rtd_theme

    extensions = [
        ...
        'sphinx_rtd_theme',
    ]

    html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"


.. note::

   Adding this theme as an extension is what enables localization of theme
   strings in your translated output. If these strings are not translated in
   your output, either we lack the localized strings for your locale, or you
   are using an old version of the theme.
